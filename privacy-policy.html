    <title>Tierly Volume Discount App – Privacy Policy</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Tierly Volume Discount App Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 24/12/2025</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Opps Solutions ("we," "us," or "our")
        collects, uses, and discloses information in connection with your use of the
        Tierly Volume Discount App (the "App"). The App is built for merchants
        ("Merchants") who use Shopify to power their online stores.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Scope of This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This policy applies only to the data handled by the Tierly Volume Discount App
        installed on your Shopify store. We process data primarily to enable the
        discount functionalities configured by the Merchant.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        The Tierly Volume Discount App is designed to minimize the collection and
        storage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    </p>

    <h3>A. Merchant Configuration Data (Stored)</h3>
    <p>
        When a Merchant configures and saves settings within the App, we collect and
        store this necessary setup data. This data is stored securely using Shopify
        Metafields tied to the Merchant's store.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Type of Data Stored:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Discount rules (e.g., percentage, fixed amount)</li>
        <li>Tier configurations (e.g., quantity thresholds)</li>
        <li>Associated Product IDs or collection identifiers</li>
        <li>Internal application settings and identifiers necessary for the Shopify Functions to operate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is essential for the App to function and
        apply the volume discount rules defined by the Merchant.
    </p>

    <h3>B. Shopper Data (Processed, Not Stored)</h3>
    <p>
        The core discount logic is executed using a Shopify Function during the
        checkout process (cart calculation). While running the Function, the App
        processes transient, non-PII cart data to determine if a discount applies.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Type of Data Processed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Line item product IDs and SKUs</li>
        <li>Quantities of items in the cart</li>
        <li>Current item prices</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Storage:</strong> This data is processed in real-time by the Shopify
        Function and is not stored, logged, or retained by the Tierly Volume Discount
        App itself. It is used only for the immediate calculation of the eligible
        discount.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Installation and Authentication Data</h3>
    <p>
        Upon installation, we receive basic non-PII information from Shopify required
        for App operation.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Data Collected:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shop name</li>
        <li>Shopify permanent access token (required for API access)</li>
        <li>Internal Shop ID</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> To authenticate the Merchant and ensure secure
        communication with the Shopify API for reading and writing Metafields.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Service Provision:</strong> To enable the core functionality of
            the Tierly Volume Discount App, including the application of configured
            volume discounts at checkout.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>App Maintenance:</strong> To troubleshoot, monitor, and improve
            the performance and reliability of the App and its Shopify Function.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Authentication:</strong> To maintain the connection and
            authentication session with the Merchant's Shopify Admin.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell or rent any information we collect. We only share or disclose
        information in the following limited circumstances:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>With Shopify:</strong> We operate entirely within the Shopify
            infrastructure. All data stored (Metafields) remains within the Shopify
            ecosystem, subject to Shopify's security measures.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> If required by law, subpoena, or
            government request, we may disclose information to comply with legal
            obligations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Merchant Configuration Data (Metafields) is retained as long as the Tierly
        Volume Discount App remains installed on the Merchant's store. If the Merchant
        uninstalls the App, all associated configuration Metafields will be deleted
        within 30 days of uninstallation.
    </p>

    <p>
        As noted in Section 2B, shopper data processed by the Shopify Function is
        ephemeral and is not retained.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights (GDPR and CCPA)</h2>
    <p>
        As the data controller for your store's customer data, the Merchant is
        responsible for ensuring compliance with privacy laws (such as GDPR and
        CCPA). Since the Tierly App does not store PII for shoppers, requests regarding
        shopper data must be directed to the Merchant.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Merchants:</strong> If you wish to access, rectify, or delete the
        configuration data associated with the App, please contact us using the
        information below.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our
        practices or for legal reasons. We will post the revised policy on this page
        and update the "Effective Date."
    </p>

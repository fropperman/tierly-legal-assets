Tierly Volume Discount App Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 24/12/2025
This Privacy Policy describes how Opps Solutions ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information in connection with your use of the Tierly Volume Discount App (the "App"). The App is built for merchants ("Merchants") who use Shopify to power their online stores.
1. The Scope of This Policy
This policy applies only to the data handled by the Tierly Volume Discount App installed on your Shopify store. We process data primarily to enable the discount functionalities configured by the Merchant.
2. Information We Collect
The Tierly Volume Discount App is designed to minimize the collection and storage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
A. Merchant Configuration Data (Stored)
When a Merchant configures and saves settings within the App, we collect and store this necessary setup data. This data is stored securely using Shopify Metafields tied to the Merchant's store.
Type of Data Stored:
Discount rules (e.g., percentage, fixed amount).
Tier configurations (e.g., quantity thresholds).
Associated Product IDs or collection identifiers.
Internal application settings and identifiers necessary for the Shopify Functions to operate.
Purpose: This data is essential for the App to function and apply the volume discount rules defined by the Merchant.
B. Shopper Data (Processed, Not Stored)
The core discount logic is executed using a Shopify Function during the checkout process (cart calculation). While running the Function, the App processes transient, non-PII cart data to determine if a discount applies.
Type of Data Processed:
Line Item Product IDs and SKUs
Quantities of items in the cart
Current item prices
Storage: This data is processed in real-time by the Shopify Function and is not stored, logged, or retained by the Tierly Volume Discount App itself. It is used only for the immediate calculation of the eligible discount.
C. Installation and Authentication Data
Upon installation, we receive basic non-PII information from Shopify required for App operation:
Data Collected: Shop name, Shopify permanent access token (required for API access), internal Shop ID.
Purpose: To authenticate the Merchant and ensure secure communication with the Shopify API for reading/writing Metafields.
3. How We Use the Information
We use the data collected strictly for the following purposes:
Service Provision: To enable the core functionality of the Tierly Volume Discount App, including the application of configured volume discounts at checkout.
App Maintenance: To troubleshoot, monitor, and improve the performance and reliability of the App and its Shopify Function.
Authentication: To maintain the connection and authentication session with the Merchant's Shopify Admin.
4. Sharing and Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent any information we collect. We only share or disclose information in the following limited circumstances:
With Shopify: We operate entirely within the Shopify infrastructure. All data stored (Metafields) remains within the Shopify ecosystem, subject to Shopify's security measures.
Legal Compliance: If required by law, subpoena, or government request, we may disclose information to comply with legal obligations.
5. Data Retention
Merchant Configuration Data (Metafields) is retained as long as the Tierly Volume Discount App remains installed on the Merchant's store. If the Merchant uninstalls the App, all associated configuration Metafields will be deleted within 30 days of uninstallation.
As noted in Section 2B, Shopper data processed by the Shopify Function is ephemeral and is not retained.
6. Your Rights (GDPR and CCPA)
As the data controller for your store's customer data, the Merchant is responsible for ensuring compliance with privacy laws (like GDPR and CCPA). Since the Tierly App does not store PII for shoppers, Merchant requests for data access, rectification, or erasure concerning PII must be directed to the Merchant, not the App developer.
Merchants: If you wish to access, rectify, or delete the configuration data associated with the App, please contact us directly using the information below.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for legal reasons. We will post the revised policy on this page and update the "Effective Date."

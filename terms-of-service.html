    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 24/12/2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Tierly Volume Discount</strong>. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Tierly Volume Discount application (the "App") provided by Opps Solutions ("we," "us," or "our"). By installing the App on your Shopify store, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By installing the App, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you must uninstall the App immediately.</p>

    <h2>2. App Functionality and Service</h2>
    <p>The App is designed to allow Shopify Merchants to create and manage tiered volume discounts using Shopify Functions technology. While we strive for 100% uptime and accuracy, the service is provided "as is" and "as available."</p>

    <h2>3. Merchant Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As the Merchant, you are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The accuracy of the discount rules and tiers you configure.</li>
        <li>Ensuring your use of the App complies with all applicable local laws, consumer protection regulations, and tax requirements.</li>
        <li>Managing the customer experience and support related to any discounts applied by the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All software, code, designs, and branding associated with the App are the exclusive property of Opps Solutions. You are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App solely for your Shopify store.</p>

    <h2>5. Fees and Payment</h2>
    <p>Fees for the App are handled through the Shopify Billing API. You agree to pay all charges associated with your selected plan. We reserve the right to modify our pricing structure upon 30 days' notice.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Opps Solutions shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the App, including but not limited to lost profits, lost sales, or data loss.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may terminate this agreement at any time by uninstalling the App from your Shopify store. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App if you violate these Terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting a notice in the App admin or via email. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
